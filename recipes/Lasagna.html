    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When you're short on time or patience,<br>
         waiting an hour or more for an oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order.<br>
          That's why this recipe is so darn good â€“ you can have a perfectly microwaved baked<br>
           potato in just a little more than 10 minutes! It sounds too good to be true but,<br>
            we promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it is.
